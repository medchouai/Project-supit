# Project-supit
Website for SUPIT project 2025/26

This project aims to build a responsive website presenting Algebra University College, following the official SUPIT project requirements.
The site will include pages such as Home, About Us, News, Curriculum (login required), and Contact, along with a functional login/register system using the provided API.

Key planned features include responsive design, a working contact form, course search via autocomplete, and dynamic display of curriculum data using a JWT token.
Visual enhancements such as animations, modal dialogs, and image galleries may be added depending on project needs.

Project currently in early development. More details will be added soon.
